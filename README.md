Calculator
==========
1) I used android developer(https://developer.android.com) to learn about coding in android and I used Youtube and StackOverflow for debugging and other issues. 

2) My code is a very simple calculator that takes in two integers and depending on the operators (buttons) you use, it will return the resulting value.
